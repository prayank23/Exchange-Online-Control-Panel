I have tried to create a tool which will include many methods to make the work easier for Office 365 Administrators. Mainly it all started with an idea to minimize the usage of PowerShell for simple tasks which could have been added to the portal or EXO but they are not. Secondly, there are some things which look just impossible to be done from the browser (OAC and EAC). The ideas here is not moving away from PowerShell but giving a choice to the customers from GUI and PowerShell. The people who love GUI can still create and run their scripts in CLI but people who are comfortable with GUI sometimes donâ€™t have a choice in Office 365.

**Requirements:**
 
.Net Framework 4.0
Azure AD Module for PowerShell
Microsoft Online Services Sign-In Assistant
